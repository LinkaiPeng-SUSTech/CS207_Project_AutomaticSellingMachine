# CS207_Project_AutomaticSellingMachine
This is the project for CS207 in 2020-2021 Fall at SUSTech, which is an automatic selling machine.

It has three main features:
1. We can query each item for its name, price, remaining numbers etc.
2. We can buy different items with different numbers at the same time. We can select numbers of items and kinds of money automatically.
3. We can enter manager status to query number of items sold and money made. We can add new items to the machine or reset the machine.
